/*

- Javascript uses 64 bits to store a single number value. negative numbers use a bit to store the sign (-)
- CALCULATIONS WITH FRACTIONS ARE NOT PRECISE
- To prevent unexpected TYPE CONVERSION use a === b or a !== b, if both sides are the same type use == or !=
- To set DEFAULT VALUES use ||. console.log(name || "default"); if name is null or 0 or NaN or ""(empty string) then the default will be used

Types
  Numbers: can be represented by : 705, -705, 7.05, 7.05e2, Infinity, -Infinity, NAN (Not A Number, results when 0/0).
  Booleans: true, false ( 0 == false, 1 == true, '' == false)
  Strings: 'a string', "another string", `one more string`
    escaping characters with \: \n: new line, \t: tab, \\: backslash
    template literals: `${100/50} 100/50` will evaluate what is inside output: 2 100/50
  Empty Values: null, undefined (null == undefined)
    Testing for real Values: (null == Value) will be true only if value==null or value==undefined otherwise will be false

Operators:
  + addition with number and concatenation with strings
  - substraction
  * multiplication
  / division
  % module
  i+=2, i-=2, i*=2, i++, i--
  typeof VAR will specified the type of the variable VAR
  condition ? true : false; conditional operator.

  Comparison:
    >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, ===, !==

  Logical Operators:
    &&, ||, ! (logical negation)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bindings
  var (pre-2015), let, const (useful for binding that give a name to a value i.e [const ONE = 1;])
  let x = 1, y =2;

  Casting:
    Number("100"); //returns the number 100 not the string "100", Number("") = 0, Number(true) = 1, Number(false || null) = 0
    String(Object)   or    Object.toString()
    Boolean()    Symbol()

Control Flow
  Conditional:
    if (expression) {
      statement
    } else if (){
  }else { }

    expression? true: false;

    switch(value){
      case "one":
        console.log("something less than 3");
      case "two":
        console.log("something less than 3");
        break;                                    will evaluate case "two" even though case "one" was evaluated because there is not a break clause
      default:
        console.log("something bigger than 3");
        break;
    }

  Loops:
    for(let i=0; i<10; i++){
      if (expression_1) break;          // break will terminate the 'for' and jump out of the loop
      if (expression_2) continue;       // continue will jump to the next iteration
      console.log(i);
    }

   let yourName;
   do{
    yourName = prompt("enter your name");
  }while(!yourName); console.log(yourName)

   let counter = 1;
   while(counter < 10){
    console.log(counter++);
   }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions (how to declare)
declaration notation (does not need the ending semicolon and can be declared anywhere in the scope)
function square(){
    return x*x;
}

const square = function(x){
    return x*x;
}

Arrow functions
const square = (x) => { return x*x; };
const square = x => x*x;          when theres only one parameter, parenthesis can be omited. if the body is a single expression, that expression would be returned.
const power = (base, exp) => {
    let result = 1;
    for (let count = 0; count <= exp; count++){
        result*=base;
    }
    return result;
}

LET and CONST are local to the block {} where they are declare.
pre-2015 only functions created new scopes. so VAR is visible in the whole function even if declared inside a loop.
each local scope can see all local scopes that contain it.

function optional arguments
    square(4, true, "more arguments"); the language doesnt complain and computes the square of the first argument. extra parameters are ignored. if you pass fewer parameters, the missing ones will get assigned the value undefined.
    power (base, exp = 2){...}   to declare default parameter values use = sign. power(4) //16    power(2,6) //64
Rest Arguments: in order for a function to accept any number of arguments use ...   they are treated as an array. if there are other arguments their values are not part of the array (i.e function(x,y,...numbers){})
    function max(...numbers) {
        for (let number of numbers) {
        let numbers = [5, 1, 7];   max(...numbers); you can use rest argument notation(...) to call a function with an array of arguments. (it will extract the values from the array and pass them as individual arguments)
                                   It is possible to include an array like that along with other arguments, as in max(9, ...numbers, 2)
    Square bracket array notation similarly allows the triple-dot operator to spread another array into the new array.
    let words = ["never", "fully"];
    console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);      // ["will", "never", "fully", "understand"]

Closure:
    being able to reference a specific local binding in an enclosing scope. (a function that references bindings from local scopes around it)
    function rememberN(n){
        return () => n;
    }
    let remember5 = rememberN(5);
    console.log(remember5());               = 5

Recursion:
    a function that calls itself, but in Javascript recursion calls are 3 times slower than looping version.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Structures Objects and Arrays
Arrays:
let listOfNumber = [2,5,7,9,8,2];
listOfNumber[0];    //2

listOfNumber.push(4);       [2,5,7,9,8,2,4]
listOfNumber.unshift(33);   [33,2,5,7,9,8,2,4]

listOfNumber.pop();     //4 and array is [33,2,5,7,9,8,2]
listOfNumber.shift();   //33 and array is [2,5,7,9,8,2]

listOfNumber.indexOf(2)         //0     will return -1 if the value is not on the array(could not find the index )
listOfNumberlastIndexOf(2)      //5     both methods can take a second optional argument where to start searching

listOfNumber.slice(2,4)         //[7,9]     slice(included,notIncluded)
listOfNumber.slice(2)           //[7, 9, 8, 2]     slice(included) until the end

function remove(array, index) {
  return array.slice(0, index)
    .concat(array.slice(index + 1));
}
console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2));
// → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]
concat glue arrays together.  if concat argument is not an array that element will be added to the array as a one-element-array.

listOfNumber.includes(8)  //true   checks whether a given value exists in the array
Array loops:
for-of
    for (let i = 0; i < JOURNAL.length; i++) {                      for (let entry of JOURNAL) {
        let entry = JOURNAL[i];                         ===             console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);
        // Do something with entry                                   }
    }

Strings:
console.log("Jorge"[2]);                        // r       similar accessing characters as arrays accessing elements
console.log("coconuts".slice(4, 7));            // nut
console.log("one two three".indexOf("ee"));     // 11      indexOf can take search a string containing more than one character
console.log("  okay \n ".trim());               // okay    trim removes whitespace (spaces, new lines, tabs)
console.log(String(6).padStart(3, "0"));        // 006      padStart(total length, pad with this character)
console.log("LA".repeat(3));                    // LALALA

let sentence = "Secretarybirds specialize in stomping";
let words = sentence.split(" ");                            split deletes the character separator and add the words to an array
console.log(words);                             // ["Secretarybirds", "specialize", "in", "stomping"]
console.log(words.join(". "));                  // Secretarybirds. specialize. in. stomping     takes the elements from the array and join them into a string using the argument as "separator"


Objects:
values of type object are arbitrary collection of properties.

Creating objects:
- with braces (list properties separated by commas, and each property has a name (invalid binding names need to be quoted) and a value after colon)
    let day1 = {
        squirrel:                   false,
        events:                     ["work","pizza","running"],
        "this is another property": "a property"
    };

to add properties or replace values of already existing properties in objects we can:   day1.wolf = false;
the 'in' operator tells if an object has a property of that name. :                     console.log("squirrel" in day1);   //true
hasOwnPropertyis an alternative for 'in' operator: (ignores the object prototype)       day1.hasOwnProperty("squirrel");   //true
to find the keys or properties of an object (not in the prototype):                     Object.keys(OBJECT);   //["key1","key2",...,"keyN",]
to copy all properties (or replace if already exist) of an ObjectB to an Object A use:  Object.assign(objectA, objectB);
When you compare objects with JavaScript’s == operator, it compares by identity: it will produce true only if both objects are precisely the same value. Comparing different objects will return false, even if they have identical properties.

if a property name in brace notation isn’t followed by a value i.e{events:events, becameASquirrel:squirrel}, its value is taken from the binding with the same name.
function addEntry(events, squirrel) {
  journal.push({events, squirrel});
}


Math Object:
it provides mainly a namespace for math function names.
Math.max();
Math.min();
Math.sqrt();
Math.PI
Math.floor();
Math.ceil();
Math.round();
Math.abs();
Math.random();      returns a value between 0 (included) and 1 (expluded)

Destructuring Arrays and Objects:
Rename binding of an array argument
    function phi([n00, n01, n10 , n11]){
        now we can refer to table[0] as n00, table[1] as n01 ....
    }
    let table = [2,4,6,8];
    phi(table);

    let a,b,rest;
    [a, ,...rest] = [2,4,6,8,10];     //a=2  rest=[6,8,10]          //we can skip values but ...rest has to be on the right most position. to assign default value use [a,b=7] = [2]   //a=2 b=7
similar with objects
    let a,b,rest;
    ({a, b:newB, ...rest} = {a:2, b:4, c:6, d:8});     //a=2   b=undefined because we are renaming the bind to newB using "b:newB"   newB=4    rest={c:6, d:8}   //it has to be between () otherwise it will think its a block and will give an error

unpacking fields from objects passed as function parameters
    const user = {
        id: 42,
        displayName: 'jdoe',
        fullName: {
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe'
        }
    };
    function userId({id}) {
        return id;
    }
    function whois({displayName, fullName: {firstName: name}}) {
        return `${displayName} is ${name}`;
    }

JSON JavaScript Object Notation (property names have to be surrounded by "" and only simple data exressions are allowed) file.json
let string = JSON.stringify({squirrel: false,
                            events: ["weekend"]});      creates a string with valid JSON
console.log(string);                                    // {"squirrel":false,"events":["weekend"]}
console.log(JSON.parse(string).events);                 // ["weekend"]          parse, constructs the JavaScript value or object described by the string
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Higher Order Functions
HOF are function that operate on other functions either as arguments or by returning them.(very useful for data processing)

HOF standard array methods
Arrays HOF methods:
findIndex:      returns the position(index) of the first element in the array that satisfies functionTest    array.findIndex(functionTest);
some:           returns a boolean if at leas one element of the array passes functionTest   array.some(functionTest(element){});
forEach:        array.forEach(function);        (does not return anything) is an array built-in fucntion that provides something like for-of as a HOF   (i.e  ["A", "B"].forEach(l => console.log(l));)    code unit 16 bits same as length method and accessing with string[1] or string.charCodeAt(position != (string.codePointAt(position)) or for-of) both use 2 units
filter:         array.filter(functionTest);     returns a new array with the elements that passed the functionTest
map:            array.map(transformFunction);   returns a new array after applying the transformFunction to all the elements of the original array
reduce:         array.reduce(reducerFunction, intialValue);   returns a single output value after executing a reducerFunction on each element
                reducerFunction(accumulator,currentElement){...}
                examples:
                let scores = [90,30,20,75,85,95,0,55];
                let total = scores.reduce((accumulator,element) => accumulator+element,0);   //typical use of reduce.
                let minMax = scores.reduce((acc,score)=> [Math.min(acc[0],score), Math.max(acc[1],score)] ,[Infinity,0]);    //reduce can return a different type of value inthis case [min,max]

                const students = [
                    {userid:'stevenh',
                    name:'steve',
                    passFail:true
                    },
                    {userid:'debbw',
                    name:'deb',             //we want to access an object using the userid: studentsObj.debbw = {Object with debbw info}
                    passFail:true
                    },
                    {userid:'maxv',
                    name:'Max',
                    passFail:false
                    }
                ];
                let studentsObj = students.reduce(function(acc,person){
                return {...acc, [person.userid]: person}
            },{});
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Secret Life Of objects
This:
        When a function is called as a method—looked up as a property and immediately called, as in object.method()—the binding called this in its body automatically points at the object that it was called on.
call:   Think of "this" as an extra parameter that is passed in a different way. If you want to pass it explicitly, you can use a function’s "call" method, which takes the this value as its first argument and treats further arguments as normal parameters. method.call(thisDesiredObject,methodParameters);
        speak.call(hungryRabbit, "Burp!");     where function speak(str){console.log(str);}    and     hungryRabbit = {type: "hungry", speak};
        Arrow functions do not bind their own 'this' but can see the 'this' binding of the scope around them
            function normalize() {
                             \/------------------------| reference to the surrounding scope
                console.log(this.coords.map(n => n / this.length));
            }
            normalize.call({coords: [0, 2, 3], length: 5});         // → [0, 0.4, 0.6]
Prototype:

Object.prototype is at the root of tree-shapped structure. it provides a few methods that show up in all object such as object.toString(); (only constructor functions have a .property, INSTANCES DO NOT have a .prototype they have a __proto__)
Functions derive from Function.prototype, and arrays derive from Array.prototype.
getPrototypeOf:     returns the prototype of an object. Object.getPrototypeOf(object);  (if object = {} then // Object.prototype  == {})
setPrototypeOf:     sets a prototype of an object. (use create instead) Object.setPrototypeOf(object, prototypeObject);
creating objects
create:             You can use Object.create to create an object with a specific prototype. let newObject = Object.create(prototypeObject);
                    let newObj = {
                        property1: value1,
                        property2: value2,
                        method1(){ method1Body},                        //shorthand way of defining a method
                        method2: function(paramMethod2){ method2Body}
                    }

                    let newObj = new Object();  // create and object with Object constructor and then add properties and methods
                    newObj.property1 = value1;
                    newObj.method1 = function(){}

                    function objConstructor(paramConstructor){
                        this.property1 = value1;
                        this.property2 = value2;                        this properties will be directly on the object constructor not on the prototype
                        this.method1 = function(){};
                    }
                    let newObj = new objConstructor(paramConstructor)

Classes: (function declarations are hoisted (can be declared after being used, classes declarations are NOT))
a class defines the shape of a type of object. the constructor makes sure the instances derived from the class have defined their own properties and the proper prototype assigned.
    function makeRabbit(type) {
        let rabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
        rabbit.type = type;
        return rabbit;
    }
Class Notation: (methods and only methods will be added to the prototype during class declaration (they can be added later), the constructor will have a special treatment)
    class Rabbit {
      constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
      }
      speak(line) {
        console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
      }
    }
    let killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");

Constructor: (constructor names are Capitalized.   constructors prototype = Function.prototype.    instances prototype = constructor.protottype)
using NEW in front of a function will treat the function as a constructor (This means that an object with the right prototype is automatically created, bound to this in the function, and returned at the end of the function.)
    function Rabbit(type) {
        this.type = type;
        }
        Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
        console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
    };
    let weirdRabbit = new Rabbit("weird");

Map: (use for-of to return an array [key, value]) some methods of map: get(key), has(key), set(key,value), delete(key). Object.keys doesnt work on Maps (It has a keys method, but that returns an iterator rather than an array. An iterator (or iterable value) can be converted to an array with the Array.from function.)
is dangerous using objects as maps i.e let objMap = { pedro: 35}; be careful because ("toString" in objMap) == true
posible solutions:
- create an object without a prototype:     let newObj = Object.create(null)
- create a Map: (allows any type of keys)   let newObj = new Map();     newObj.set("pedro",39);   newObj["pedro"] = 39;

Symbols: symbols are unique and can be used as property names (pair symbol as property, value will not be displayed with for-in loop, also will be ignored with JSON.stringify) always use saque braquets when using symbols as property name
let sym = Symbol("name");               //The string you pass to Symbol is included when you convert it to a string with sym.toString()
console.log(sym == Symbol("name"));     // → false
Rabbit.prototype[sym] = 55;
console.log(blackRabbit[sym]);          // → 55

Iterator:
if an object is iterable then it means that it has a method named with the Symbol.iterator symbol. when called, that method should return an object that provides a second interface, 'iterator'. This is the actual thing that iterates. It has a next method that returns the next result. That result should be an object with a value property that provides the next value, if there is one, and a done property, which should be true when there are no more results and false otherwise
    let okIterator = "OK"[Symbol.iterator]();
    console.log(okIterator.next());             // → {value: "O", done: false}
    console.log(okIterator.next());             // → {value: "K", done: false}
    console.log(okIterator.next());             // → {value: undefined, done: true}

Getters:
properties that are accessed directly may hide a method call. Such methods are called getters.
let varyingSize = {
  get size() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  }
};
console.log(varyingSize.size);      // → 73    its called as a property not as a method

Setter:
change or mutate properties
    const person = {
        firstName : "jorge",
        lastName : "castano",
        get fullName(){
            return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
        },
        set fullName(value){
            let [first,last] = value.split(" ");
            this.firstName = first;
            this.lastName = last;
        }
    }
    console.log(person.fullName);               //jorge castano
    person.fullName = "carlos ramirez";
    console.log(person.fullName);               //carlos ramirez

Static: does not require an instance to be create in order to be used. it needs to be called directly on the class i.e Console.log() or Math.random() usually utility functions

Inheritance:
    class SubClass extends SuperClass{
        constructor(arguments){
            super(arguments){...
            }
        }
        methodToModify(arguments){//this will override the old method
            super.methodToModify();
        }
    }

instanceOf:     let you know if an object is derived from a specific class. i.e console.log([1] instanceof Array);      // → true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs and Errors

strict mode: converts syntactic mistakes into errors such as counter=3; will throw a ReferenceError: counter is not defined (will not allow you to create global variables without being defined previously)
            prevents modifying non writable properties in an object. prevents trying to write on a getter property
            doesnt allow same names as function parameters (usually is an error) function sum(a,a,b){...}
            Another change in strict mode is that the this binding holds the value undefined in functions that are not called as methods.
            When making such a call outside of strict mode, this refers to the global scope object, which is an object whose properties are the global bindings
put at the top of a file or a function body, "use strict";

Types: often errors are due to being confused about the type of parameters or function return values so it may help making comments.
    // (VillageState, Array) → {direction: string, memory: Array}
    function goalOrientedRobot(state, memory) {
      // ...
    }
another alternative for making javascript check for types is typescript.

Exceptions:
Exceptions are a mechanism that makes it possible for code that runs into a problem to raise (or throw) an exception.
    function look() {
      if (prompt("Which way?") == "left") {
        return "a house";
      } else {
          throw new Error("Invalid direction: " + result);          //  'throw' is used to raise an exception.
      }
    }

    try {                                                           // 'try - catch' used to catch exceptions: Other options try-finally  try-catch-finally
      console.log("You see", look());
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Something went wrong: " + error);                //printing or checking error.stack will help to debug the problem
  }finally{
  console.log("this will run either theres an exception or not ");
}

Selective Catching:
Define a new type of error and use instanceof to identify it.
    class InputError extends Error {}                           //creates a new/costumized type of error
    function promptDirection(question) {
        let result = prompt(question);
        if (result.toLowerCase() == "left") return "L";
        if (result.toLowerCase() == "right") return "R";
        throw new InputError("Invalid direction: " + result);
    }
    try {...
    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof InputError) {                          //select the new type of error
        console.log("Not a valid direction. Try again.");
    } else {                                                    //if something other "unexpected" error occurred then let it be automatically handled
            throw e;
            }
        }

Assertions: are checks inside a program that verify that something is the way it is supposed to be. They are used not to handle situations that can come up in normal operation but to find programmer mistakes.
You want to reserve assertions for mistakes that are easy to make (or that you find yourself making). programmed warnings !

Regular Expressions             Great Tool: https://regexr.com/
Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data.

Creating a regular expression
let re1 = new RegExp("abc");

Testing
console.log(re1.test("bhgkabcljl"));    //If 'abc' occurs anywhere in the string we are testing against (not just at the start), test will return true.
console.log(/abc/.test("bhgkabcljl"));  // another type of notation is with (backslashes)   /regularExp/   careful while using front and back slashes mixed

RegExp("abc")           A regular expression consisting of only nonspecial characters simply represents that sequence of characters.
RegExp([1234567890])    Putting a set of characters between square brackets makes that part of the expression match any of the characters between the brackets. true if ANY of the characters between [] is included on the string.
RegExp([a-d])           True if ANY of the characters in the range specified between [x-y] is included on the string.

A number of common character groups have their own built-in shortcuts. Digits are one of them:
\d      means the same thing as [0-9]. Any digit character
\w	    An alphanumeric character (“word character”)
\s	    Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)
\D      A character that is not a digit
\W	    A nonalphanumeric character
\S      A nonwhitespace character
.       Any character except for newline

These backslash codes can also be used inside square brackets:
i.e.     [\d.]    means any digit or a period character. But the period itself, between square brackets, loses its special meaning. The same goes for other special characters, such as +,*,|,()

^   invert a set of characters (that is you want to match any character EXCEPT the ones in the set), when used right after an opening bracket.
    let notBinary = /[^01]/;  any character different than 0's and 1's will make the string match to true.
^   Matches the start of the input string when used right after the slash /^.../
    /^!/        matches a string that starts with a !
$   Matches the start of the input string when used right before the last slash /...$/
    /\d+$/      matches a string that finishes with a digit
    /^\d+$/     matches a string consisting entirely of one or more digits
\b  makes sure the expression starts or ends on a word boundary
    console.log(/\bcat\b/.test("concatenate"));   // → false      while     console.log(/cat/.test("concatenate"));   // → true
|   the pipe character denotes a choice between the pattern to its left and the pattern to its right.
    let animalCount = /\b\d+ (pig|cow|chicken)s?\b/;    // matches a digit followed by a spcace and followed by one of the words (pig or cow or chicken or one of their plurals)
    console.log(animalCount.test("15 pigs"));   // → true

Repeating parts of a pattern
+   indicates that the element may be present once or more times.                       console.log(/'\d+'/.test("'6'"));   //true
*   indicates that the element may be repeated zero or more times.                      console.log(/'\d*'/.test("''"));    //true
?   indicates that the element is optional, is not present or present only once.        let neighbor = /neighbou?r/;        //the 'u' is optional
{5} indicates that the pattern must occur a precise number of times                     let twoConsecutiveAs = /a{2}/;      //true for any string containing one a
{x,y} indicates a range. pattern must occur between x or y times                        let oneOrTwoAs = /a{1,2}/;          //true for any string containing one or two a's
{x, } indicates patter must occur x or more times

Grouping Subexpressions
()  A part of a regular expression that is enclosed in parentheses counts as a single element as far as the operators following it are concerned
    i.e.    let cartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/i;     The first and second + characters apply only to the second o in boo and hoo, respectively. The third + applies to the whole group (hoo+), matching one or more sequences like that.
i   at the end (outside /exp/) of an expression, makes the expression case insensitive.  let jorge = /jorge/i;   //JorGe will be true

Matches
test            returns only values of true or false if the expression matches the Regular expression.
exec            returns an object with info about the match otherwise or null if no match was found
                i.e.    let match = /\d+/.exec("one two 100");  console.log(match); // ["100"]    console.log(match.index);   // 8      console.log(match.input);   // "one two 100"
String.match    String values have a match method that behaves similarly.   console.log("one two 100".match(/\d+/));
                when used with the global option g, will return all matches in an array.
                console.log("Ban1an9a7".match(/\d/g));      //["1", "9", "7"]

Groups
When the regular expression contains subexpressions grouped with parentheses, the text that matched those groups will also show up in the array. The whole match is always the first element. The next element is the part matched by the first group (the one whose opening parenthesis comes first in the expression), then the second group, and so on
    let phone = /(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})/;
    console.log(phone.exec("766602-292-85620000"));   // → ["602-292-8562", "602", "292", "8562", index: 3, input: "766602-292-85620000", groups: undefined]
When a group does not end up being matched at all (for example, when followed by a question mark), its position in the output array will hold undefined. Similarly, when a group is matched multiple times, only the last match ends up in the array.
    console.log(/bad(ly)?/.exec("bad"));    // → ["bad", undefined]
    console.log(/(\d)+/.exec("123"));   // → ["123", "3"]

Date Class:     in JavaScript months start at zero, days start at one, BE CAREFUL.
console.log(new Date());                                // → Tue Aug 04 2020 17:04:10 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)      Default date format
console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9));                     // → Wed Dec 09 2009 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)    Create Date objects for specific times
console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9, 12, 59, 59, 999));    // → Wed Dec 09 2009 12:59:59 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
console.log(new Date(2013, 11, 19).getTime());          // → 1387407600000      Timestamps are stored as the number of milliseconds since the start of 1970, in the UTC time zone.You can use negative numbers for times before 1970. The getTime method on a date object returns this number
console.log(new Date(1387407600000));                   // → Thu Dec 19 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)
console.log(new Date(Date.now()));                      //  to create a date with the current date and time

Using RegExp with Dates
    function getDate(string) {
      let [_, month, day, year] = /(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})/.exec(string);       //[_,] first element is ignored since it is the whole string
      return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
    }
    console.log(getDate("1-30-2003"));  // → Thu Jan 30 2003 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)

String Replace
String.replace(original,replacement)    Used to replace an original expression with a replacement expression. The first argument can also be a regular expression, in which case the first match of the regular expression is replaced.
g   When a g option (for global) is added to the regular expression, all matches in the string will be replaced, not just the first.
    console.log("Borobudur".replace(/[ou]/, "a"));  // → Barobudur
    console.log("Borobudur".replace(/[ou]/g, "a")); // → Barabadar
The real power of using regular expressions with replace comes from the fact that we can refer to matched groups in the replacement string
    console.log("Liskov, Barbara\nMcCarthy, John\nWadler, Philip".replace(/(\w+), (\w+)/g, "$2 $1"));   // → Barbara Liskov  John McCarthy  Philip Wadler
$   In the replacement string refer to the parenthesized groups in the pattern. $1 is replaced by the text that matched against the first group, $2 by the second, and so on, up to $9. The whole match can be referred to with $&.
It is possible to pass a function—rather than a string—as the second argument to replace. For each replacement, the function will be called with the matched groups (as well as the whole match) as arguments, and its return value will be inserted into the new string.
i.e.    let s = "the cia and fbi";
        console.log(s.replace(/\b(fbi|cia)\b/g, str => str.toUpperCase()));       // → the CIA and FBI

i.e.    let stock = "1 lemon, 2 cabbages, and 101 eggs";
        function minusOne(match, amount, unit) {
          amount = Number(amount) - 1;
          if (amount == 1) { // only one left, remove the 's'
            unit = unit.slice(0, unit.length - 1);
          } else if (amount == 0) {
            amount = "no";
          }
          return amount + " " + unit;
        }
        console.log(stock.replace(/(\d+) (\w+)/g, minusOne));   // → no lemon, 1 cabbage, and 100 eggs

Greed
having a function that removes all comments from a string.
    function stripComments(code) {
      return code.replace(/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*\*\//g, "");      // solution: return code.replace(/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*?\*\//g, "");
    }
    console.log(stripComments("1 /* a */+/* b */ 1"));    // → 1  1
/*
The part before the or operator matches two slash characters followed by any number of non-newline characters,
[^]     (any character that is not in the empty set of characters) as a way to match any character. (We cannot just use a period here because block comments can continue on a new line, and the period character does not match newline characters.)
The [^]* part of the expression, will first match as much as it can instead of matching the first match found.
Operators +,*,{},? are greedy. (meaning they match as much as they can and backtrack from there)
Putting a question mark after them (+?, *?, ??, {}?), they become nongreedy and start by matching as little as possible, matching more only when the remaining pattern does not fit the smaller match

Dynamically creating RegExp objects
backslashes (as in \b, \d etc.) need to be prefixed with a backslash because they are being written in a string not in a slash enclosed regular expression.
RegExp(exp,flags)   the second argument is a string that contains the flag options i.e. "gi" global and case insensitive.
    let name = "harry";
    let text = "Harry is a suspicious character.";
    let regexp = new RegExp("\\b(" + name + ")\\b", "gi");
    console.log(text.replace(regexp, "_$1_"));      // → _Harry_ is a suspicious character.
But if name="dea+hl[]rd" then the regular expression wont match the name. To work around this, we can add backslashes before any character that has a special meaning
    let name = "dea+hl[]rd";
    let text = "This dea+hl[]rd guy is super annoying.";
    let escaped = name.replace(/[\\[.+*?(){|^$]/g, "\\$&");
    let regexp = new RegExp("\\b" + escaped + "\\b", "gi");
    console.log(text.replace(regexp, "_$&_"));      // → This _dea+hl[]rd_ guy is super annoying.

String.search(RegExp) returns the index of the first match or -1 if no match was found. expects a regular expression unlike String.indexOf("") which expects a string
    console.log("  word".search(/\S/));     // → 2

lastIndex property: inconvenient way to start a match search from a given position.
                    controls where the next match will start but the regular expression must have the global (g) or sticky (y) option enabled, and the match must happen through the exec method. [sticky option only find a match at the lastIndex position not before or after]
                    If the match was successful, the call to exec automatically updates the lastIndex property to point after the match. If no match was found, lastIndex is set back to zero
                    CAREFUL when using the same regular expression more than once since the lastIndex property gets update and you can be searching a match on the wrong place.
    let pattern = /y/g;
    pattern.lastIndex = 3;
    let match = pattern.exec("xyzzy");
    console.log(match.index);           // → 4
    console.log(pattern.lastIndex);     // → 5

Loop over matches
    let input = "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88.";
    let number = /\b\d+\b/g;
    let match;
    while (match = number.exec(input)) {
      console.log("Found", match[0], "at", match.index);
    }   // → Found 3 at 14
        //   Found 42 at 33
        //   Found 88 at 40

Example. parsing with regular expressions
    function parseINI(string) {
      // Start with an object to hold the top-level fields
      let result = {};
      let section = result;
      string.split(/\r?\n/).forEach(line => {
        let match;
        if (match = line.match(/^(\w+)=(.*)$/)) {                   //  (matches any properties of the form word=string) properties at the top are stored directly into the result object.
          section[match[1]] = match[2];
        } else if (match = line.match(/^\[(.*)\]$/)) {              //  properties found in sections (sections are defined between []) are stored in a separated object sections inside the main result object.
          section = result[match[1]] = {};
        } else if (!/^\s*(;.*)?$/.test(line)) {                     //search for empty lines or comments (lines that start with ; )
          throw new Error("Line '" + line + "' is not valid.");
        }
      });
      return result;
    }
    console.log(parseINI(`
    name=Vasilis
    [address]
    city=Tessaloniki`));    // → {name: "Vasilis", address: {city: "Tessaloniki"}}

International characters
A “word character” in JavaScript’s regular expressions, is only one of the 26 characters in the Latin alphabet (uppercase or lowercase), decimal digits, and, for some reason, the underscore character.
Another problem is that, by default, regular expressions work on code units and not in actual characters.
    console.log(/<.>/.test("<🌹>"));    // → false          // dot matches a single code unit, not the two that make up the rose emoji
u   Option/flag Unicode makes regular expression to treat such characters properly.
    console.log(/<.>/u.test("<🌹>"));   // → true
It is possible to use \p in a regular expression (that must have the Unicode option enabled) to match all characters to which the Unicode standard assigns a given property
    console.log(/\p{Script=Greek}/u.test("α"));    // → true
Unicode defines a number of useful properties, though finding the one that you need may not always be trivial. You can use the \p{Property=Value} notation to match any character that has the given value for that property. If the property name is left off, as in \p{Name}, the name is assumed to be either a binary property such as Alphabetic or a category such as Number
    /\p{Script=scriptName}/u some of the scripts names are(http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#RL1.2): Alphabetic, Uppercase, Lowercase, White_Space, Noncharacter_Code_Point, Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, Any, ASCII, Assigned, ID_Start, ID_Continue, Join_Control, Emoji_Presentation, Emoji_Modifier, Emoji_Modifier_Base

From https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/regexp-features-regular-expressions/
(?! exp)  construct for a negative lookahead. (match a pattern only if its NOT proceded by exp) i.e.    console.log(Red(?!head)/.exec('Redhead'));   // → null
                                                                                                        console.log(Red(?!head)/.exec('Redberry'));   // → ["Red", index: 0, input: "Redberry", groups: undefined
(?<= exp) construct for lookbehind. (match a pattern only if it is preceded by exp)             i.e.    console.log(/(?<=€)\d+(\.\d*)?/.exec('€199'));
(?<! exp) negative version of lookbehind.   i.e.  /(?<!\d{3}) meters/.test();   //matches the word “meters” if three digits do not come before it
(?<name> exp)   naming groups   /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/.exec('2020-03-04');     //property .groups: {year: "2020", month: "03", day: "04"}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modules (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJWALEoGge4 different approaches to create modules)
A module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use (its interface).
The relations between modules are called "dependencies".

Packages
A package is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed). It may contain one or more modules and has information about which other packages it depends on. A package also usually comes with documentation explaining what it does so that people who didn’t write it might still be able to use it
NPM is two things: an online service where one can download (and upload) packages and a program (bundled with Node.js) that helps you install and manage them

Improvised Modules: This style of modules provides isolation, to a certain degree, but it does not declare dependencies. Instead, it just puts its interface into the global scope and expects its dependencies, if any, to do the same
    const weekDay = function() {
    const names = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                 "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
    return {
        name(number) { return names[number]; },
        number(name) { return names.indexOf(name); }
        };
    }();
    console.log(weekDay.name(weekDay.number("Sunday")));    //  Sunday

Evaluating data as code
eval(string);    will execute a string in the current scope ( usually a bad idea because it breaks some of the properties that scopes normally have)
    const x = 1;
    function evalAndReturnX(code) {
        eval(code);
        return x;
        }
    console.log(evalAndReturnX("var x = 2"));   // → 2
    console.log(x);                             // → 1
Function("arg1,arg2...", "function body");      less scary way of interpreting data as code is to use the Function constructor. (It wraps the code in a function value so that it gets its own scope and won’t do odd things with other scopes)
    let plusOne = Function("n", "return n + 1;");
    console.log(plusOne(4));    // → 5

CommonJS Modules:   - is the system used by most packages on NPM.)
                    - not supported by default by browsers consequently not optimal for asynchronous (unless use a module bundler as WebPack)
                    - loaded synchronously
                    - born with server-side JavaScript (not suitable for client-side)
The main concept in CommonJS modules is a function called 'require'. When you call this with the module name of a dependency, it makes sure the module is loaded and returns its interface.

    exports.func1 = function(){...}
    exports.func2 = (param1) => {...};

                    OR

    module.exports = {          //MODULE FILE use exports for the variables/functions that you want to expose.
        func1,
        func2
    }
    const {func1, func2} = require("./functions");              //using destructuring now we can call them individually
    func1();
    func2();

    const FunctionsModule = require("./functions");                   //now they need to be called using dot notation
    FunctionsModule.func1();
    FunctionsModule.func2();

ES (ECMAScript) Modules:    - support asynch
                            - Instead of calling a function ('require' in CommonJS) to access a dependency, you use a special 'import' keyword
                            - The 'export' keyword is used to export things. It may appear in front of a function, class, or binding definition (let, const, or var)
                            - When there is a binding named 'default', it is treated as the module’s main exported value.
                            - ES module imports happen before a module’s script starts running. That means import declarations may not appear inside functions or blocks, and the names of dependencies must be quoted strings, not arbitrary expressions
    export function func1(){...}
    export function func2(){...}
    or at the end of file
    export { func1, func2 }

    import * as FunctionsModule from './functions';     //returns an object with everything that has been exported
    FunctionsModule.func1();
    FunctionsModule.func2();

    import { func1 } from './functions';                    //to import something specific. ("name import" NOT to be confused with destructuring)
    import { func2 as newFunc } from './functions';         //its possible to rename importing bindings using the keyword 'as'.

    export default mainFunc(){...}      //
    import mainFunc from './functions';                     //will import the default export by default. (you can use another name instead of mainFunc)
    import mainFunc, { func1 as newFunc1, func2 } from './functions';   //to import from modules with mixed (dafault and no default) exports
    <script type='module' src='functions.js'></script>      //on the html document add the module with type='module' in order to make it work the html file needs to be served from a server (terminal$ http-server functions) and then open the html file on the browser
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asynchronous Programming
In a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time (a function waits (stops the program) for another one to finish and so on)
An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time.

Callbacks
A function that perform a slow action take an extra argument, a callback function. The action is started, and when it finishes, the callback function is called with the result
Nesting many asynchronous functions inside callbacks is known as the pyramid of doom or the callback hell:
    asyncFunction(param1, function(){
        asyncFunction(param1,function(){
            asyncFunction(param1,function(){
                asyncFunction(param1,function(){
                    asyncFunction(param1,function(){
                        ....
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });
Failure with callbacks: A widely used convention is that the first argument to the callback is used to indicate that the action failed, and the second contains the value produced by the action when it was successful.

Promises
A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
The easiest way to create a promise is by calling Promise.resolve
    let fifteen = Promise.resolve(15);
    fifteen.then(value => console.log(`Got ${value}`));         // → Got 15
Standard Promise used
    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        resolve("done");
        reject(new Error("…"));
    });
The most fundamental .then
    promise.then(                                                               promise.then(
      function(result) { handle a successful result  },             or              result => alert(result),
      function(error) {  handle an error  }                                         error => alert(error)
    );                                                                          );
Using .catch    [ using only promise.catch(f) is the same as promise.then(null, f)]
Using .finally  [promise.finally(function) runs when the promise is settled, doesn't matter successfully or not ]
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("result"), 2000)
    })
    .finally(() => alert("Promise ready"))          // <-- runs no matter what
    .then(result => alert(result))                  // <-- .then handles the result
    .catch(err => alert(err));                      // <-- .catch handles the error object


General Use of  Promise fetching an url
    function getData(method, url) {
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {              // Return a new promise.
            var req = new XMLHttpRequest();                         // Do the usual XHR stuff
            req.open(method, url);
            req.onload = function() {                               // This is called even on 404 etc
                if (this.status >= 200 && this.status < 300) {                            // so check the status
                    resolve(req.response);                          // Resolve the promise with the response text
                }
                else {
                    // one way to handle the rejection error: reject(Error(req.statusText));                  // Otherwise reject with the status text, which will hopefully be a meaningful error
                    reject({
                    status: this.status,
                    statusText: req.statusText
                    });
                }
            };
            req.onerror = function() {                              // Handle network errors
                // one way to handle the rejection error: reject(Error("Network Error"));
                reject({
                    status: this.status,
                    statusText: req.statusText
                });
            };
            req.send();                                             // Make the request
        });
    }
Now let's use it:
    getData('GET','jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
        .then(function(data) {
                    // simple answer displaying all the data:       console.log("Success!", data);
                    let todos = JSON.parse(data);
                    let output = '';
                    for(let todo of todos){
                                                                // in an html file create a <ul id="template">  </ul>
                        output += `
                            <li>
                                <h3> ${todo.title}</h3>
                                <p> Completed: ${todo.completed}</p>
                            </li>
                        `;
                    }
                    getElementById('template').innerHTML = output;
                }
                //optional if there is not .catch       // , function(error) {
                                                        //    console.error("Failed!", error);
                                                        // }
        ).catch(function(error){
            console.log(error);
    })
Chaining .then's
    get('story.json').then(function(response) {
        return JSON.parse(response);
    }).then(function(response) {
        console.log("Yey JSON!", response);
    })

Using Fetch to fetch an URL (Fetch uses promises):
    function status(response) {
      if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {
        return Promise.resolve(response)
      } else {
        return Promise.reject(new Error(response.statusText))
      }
    }
    function json(response) {
      return response.json()
    }
    fetch('users.json')                                         // now we actually do the request and manipulate the returned promise
      .then(status)                                             //call just the name of the function, by default the parameter will be the response
      .then(json)
      .then(function(data) {
        console.log('Request succeeded with JSON response', data);
      }).catch(function(error) {
        console.log('Request failed', error);
      });

To do something after ALL promises have resolved:    Promise.all([promise1,promise2,promise3..]).then(function(){ console.log("ALL promises have finished");});     resolves to an array of the values that these promises produced (in the same order as the original array)
To do something after ONE promise has resolved:      Promise.race([promise1,promise2,promise3..]).then(function(){ console.log("ONE promise has finished");});

Network Flooding:   For broadcasting information to the whole network, one solution is to set up a type of request that is automatically forwarded to neighbors. These neighbors then in turn forward it to their neighbors, until the whole network has received the message.

Async-Await
Async:  The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically
i.e 1   async function f(){
            return "something";
        }
        f().then(alert);    // something
i.e 2   async function wait() {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
            return 10;
        }
        function f() {
            wait().then(result => alert(result));             // shows 10 after 1 second
        }
        f();
Await:  The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
        Await only works inside an Async function. including an async iife i.e (async ()=>{  let response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/${"jorge castano"}`)})();
    async function f() {
        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
        });
        let result = await promise;                             // wait until the promise resolves (*)
        alert(result);                                          // "done!"
    }
    f();
Await Error handling: In the case of a rejection, await throws the error, just as if there were a throw statement at that line.
    async function f() {                                            async function f() {
      await Promise.reject(new Error("Whoops!"));       =               throw new Error("Whoops!");
  }                                                                 }
We can catch that error using try..catch, the same way as a regular throw:
    async function f() {
      try {
        let response = await fetch('/no-user-here');
        let user = await response.json();
      } catch(err) {                                    // catches errors both in fetch and response.json
            alert(err);
        }
    }
    f();
If we don’t have try..catch, then the promise generated by the call of the async function f() (in the above example) becomes rejected. We can append .catch to handle it:
    async function f() {
      let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');
    }                                                  // f() becomes a rejected promise
    f().catch(alert);                                  // TypeError: failed to fetch

Generators:     Is a function (proceded with an asterisc *) that can stop midway and then continue from where it stopped.
                Creates an object that is iterable (cannot be instatiated directly)
                iterable.next() = {value: actualValue, done: trueOrFalse}
i.e 1   function* generateSequence() {
            let variable1 = yield 1;
            console.log(variable1);                                     //   2. two way
            let variable2 = yield "P";
            console.log(variable2);                                     //   4. 5
            return 3;
        }
        let generator = generateSequence();
        let one = generator.next("ignored");        //The first call generator.next() should be always made without an argument (the argument is ignored if passed)
        alert(JSON.stringify(one));                                     //   1. {"value":1,"done":false}
        console.log(generator.next("two way").value);                   //   3. P
        generator.next(5);
i.e 2 creating iterables with generator
        const myIterable = {
            *[Symbol.iterator]() {
                yield 1;
                yield 2;
                yield 3;
            }
        }
        for (let value of myIterable) {
            console.log(value);
        }                                       // 1     // 2     // 3
        or
        [...myIterable];                        // [1, 2, 3]
i.e 3
        Group.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function*() {
            for (let i = 0; i < this.members.length; i++) {
                yield this.members[i];
            }
        };

libraries to use generator:     (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO07THdLWQo)
    bluebird:  best for Client / Browser side.
    co:        NodeJS / back / server side.
    q:         Angular
i.e. using co
        const fetchJson = co.wrap(function * (url) {
            try {
                let request = yield fetch(url);
                let text = yield request.text();
                return JSON.parse(text);
            }
            catch (error) {
                console.log(`ERROR: ${error.stack}`);
            }
        });

The Event Loop
    JS Engine/Call Stack -> Web API -> Callback queue -> JS Engine/Call Stack -> ...
    JS Engine/Call Stack:   Stores the functions to be executed.
    Web Api:                Hosting environment (Browser or NodeJS) threads
    Callback queue:         Sends the callback function to be executed back to the JS Engine/Call Stack.

SEARCH
    - difference between for-in (loop over properties names in Objects or "0" , "1", ... in arrays) / for-of (loop over values) mostly used for arrays. the object is expected to be 'iterable' / forEach for Arrays (method executes a provided function once for each array element) expects a synchronous function,does not wait for promises.

Notes:

    Correlation Equation:
    ϕ =	n11n00 − n10n01/ squareRoot(n1• n0• n•1 n•0)    where n10 is the # of measurements where first variable true and second variable false
                                                        where n1• is the sum of of all measurements where the first variable is true
                                                        where n•0 is the sum of of all measurements where the second variable is false
    i.e     no squirrel no pizza 76           no squirrel pizza 9
            squirrel no pizza    4            squirrel pizza    1
            dividend 1×76−4×9 = 40            the divisor square root of 5×85×10×80, or √340000
            ϕ = 0.069 so there is no correlation eating pizza doesnt make you transform into a squirrel
